//Both any and unknown allow you to opt-out of type checking in TypeScript, but they do so in different ways. any is the most permissive and allows any operation without type checking, while unknown requires you to perform type checking before using the variable. Using any can lead to a loss of type safety, while unknown helps maintain type safety by requiring explicit type handling.
