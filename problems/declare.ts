//The declare keyword in TypeScript is a powerful feature that allows you to inform the TypeScript compiler about the existence of entities that are defined outside of your TypeScript code. This is crucial for working with JavaScript libraries or global variables in a TypeScript project, ensuring that your code is type-safe and free of compilation errors.



declare var variableName: Type;
declare function functionName(arg1: Type, arg2: Type): ReturnType;
declare class ClassName {
    // class members
}
